//! mpsc_requests rewritted for crossbeam, written by @stjepang (https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues/353#issuecomment-484013974)
//!
//! mpsc_requests is a small library built on top of crossbeam-channel but with
//! the addition of the consumer responding with a message to the producer.
//! Since the producer no longer only produces and the consumer no longer only consumes, the
//! Producer is renamed to [Requester] and the Consumer is renamed to [Responder].
//!
//! mpsc_requests is small and lean by only building on top of the rust standard library
//!
//! A perfect use-case for this library is single-threaded databases which need
//! to be accessed from multiple threads (such as SQLite)
//!
//! # Examples
//! For more examples, see the examples directory
//!
//! For even more examples see the tests in the tests directory
//!
//! ## Simple echo example
//! ```rust,run
//! use std::thread;
//! use mpsc_requests::channel;
//!
//! type RequestType = String;
//! type ResponseType = String;
//! let (responder, requester) = channel::<RequestType, ResponseType>();
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!     responder.poll_loop(|mut req| {
//!         req.respond(req.body().clone());
//!     });
//! });
//! let msg = String::from("Hello");
//! let res = requester.request(msg.clone());
//! assert_eq!(res, msg);
//! ```
